# 003_bubbleio_json_email

**Dynamic JSON Builder & Email Automation (Bubble.io â†’ Email)**

## Project Context
A client needed to automate the transformation of structured form data from Bubble.io into a robust, standards-compliant JSON payload, then deliver it reliably via email. The process had to be resilient to malformed input and email delivery failures.

## Problem Solved
- Automated handoff from no-code form (Bubble.io) to email with strict schema.
- Ensured payloads are valid, complete, and delivered reliably.
- Handles edge cases: missing fields, invalid email addresses, delivery retries.

## Technical Approach
- Modular Python logic for payload build and email delivery.
- Implements retry/backoff for email send failures.
- Logs and escalates errors for operational resilience.
- Short, high-context comments for maintainability.

## Tech Stack & Highlights
- **Tech:** Python, Bubble.io, Email API (SMTP or transactional)
- **Highlights:**
  - Modular helpers for payload and email
  - Retry/backoff logic for delivery
  - Edge-case validation and error escalation

## Outcome
- Reduced manual intervention for client operations.
- Increased reliability of form-to-email automation.

## For Reviewers
- See `snippet.py` for centerpiece logic: modular, robust, and production-minded.
- Note: error handling, retry/backoff, and schema validation.
